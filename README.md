## Project 2 Goals

In your second project you will create a full stack Express and Postgres app which has:
- *At least x2 models, and utilize and build at least one relationship between the two models.*

- *An Express server utilizing EJS/EJS layouts for UI design and styling.*
- *Interaction with and inclusion of at least one API.*

## Project 2 Pitch Guidelines

In designing and building your project, you will start by forking and cloneing this repository, and then editing this README to include the following information: 
1. Name of your app
Project 2, for now
2. Tech stack you plan to use
Javascript is the main thing that will be used to create and build the app. Possibly css for styling at a later time.
3. Simple wireframes
Lucid will be used to create wireframes
5. API you plan to use
I have some in mind, 
Harry Potter
Food: pancakes, donuts, going to look into likes or even dislikes
6. ERD
I have not drawn any up, YET.
7. Example of how to call/invoke your API, and a description of what data comes back.
While there are a few ways of invoking an API, I MIGHT sitck to using AXIOS.
8. MVP goals (x3-5)
Main goal at the moment will be to display the information from the API
9. Stretch goals (x2-5)
10. Any potential roadblocks?
